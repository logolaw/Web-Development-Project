  <h3>Favorite Project Project</h3>
  <p>One of my favorite projects was Python. Analyzing the long lines of code to develop a stock inventory and a game. I found that when relating the assignemnt to sports or in terms that I could understand better it made the project easier. Specifically when track a players statlines and developing a box score for multiple players using assists, points, steals, rebounds, fouls and turnovers. </p>
